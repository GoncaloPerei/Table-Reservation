## Definition
Table Reservation is an web application to reserve a table at a restaurant. This is an open-source project was developed with the purpose of being a work for college. Later it continued to be developed by the creator because he was immensely interested in the concept.

## Problem

- ***Some papers were lost***;
- ***Searching for the correct reserve paper was difficult***;
- ***Space to place papers was limited***;
- ***The worker had to manually mark the client's reservation***;

This were only some of the issues the creator faced which lead to the creation of the project.
